Extra Analytics is a Django app to collect extra information on where users are on your website
We will also track what OS the user is visiting, and the amount of requests they made total.


Quick start

Some optional settings are:
    ANALYTICS_BLOCKED_PATHS:

        Default is True

    ANALYTICS_REQUEST_TYPE_BLOCK_LIST:
